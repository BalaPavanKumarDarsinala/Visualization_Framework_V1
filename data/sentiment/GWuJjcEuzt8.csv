okay so hi everyone this is my first movie review so I watched burlesque the past week and well it wasn't a bad movie considering you know that's there's not much hype of it in Singapore actually so first things first Christina Aguilera's pipes I swear they are who did that why I say that is because she's got a crazy crazy voice and she showcases it really really well in this movie you know she sings tough love and you know the classic songs and you know it makes you want to know who else you know in the industry nowadays has the voice like that and you know it's no wonder that you know she gets to choose the song because she's the executive music producer in the movie so you know she should be an voice anyway next would be Cher who has been away for like probably centuries I think but you know she my mom says she's probably like 60 70 years old but she still looks like she's 48,0.4,68.23,POSITIVE,0.997252881526947,0.997252881526947
and her face doesn't move at all because when you see her face moves it feels like you know you feel worried for her you feel like her face is gonna fall apart and overall the movie is quite entertaining the dancers wonderful it's sexy but not slutty you know there's not much of nudity except for you know the male lead who is drop date gorgeous by the way but I'm a girl so that's not the point the point is the sounds in the movie are wonderful you know it matches the whole theme of the movie you know cabaret and you know,68.84,107.74,POSITIVE,0.9976544976234436,0.9976544976234436
the works and overall probably I get it about 3 .5 stars you know popcorn movie and you know considering all the awesome movies that we had in the year like Inception and Black Swan and you know the social network this one you know probably in the middle so 3 .5 stars and if you have money to spend go ahead,108.74,131.92,POSITIVE,0.999251663684845,0.999251663684845
