YouTube civilian snowman here and today I'm going to review Zombieland the new movie starring Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson The plot follows two survivors of a zombie apocalypse called Columbus played by Jesse Eisenberg and Tallahassee played by Woody Harrelson Who have named themselves after the places to which they're travelling Which I think is a really nice touch as they do that to avoid becoming emotionally attached to each other.,0.48,24.56,POSITIVE,0.9926982522010803,0.9926982522010803

"OCD like, he's got loads of rules of how to Survive a zombie apocalypse and he's kind of always been a social outcast and a bit of a loner and When he meets Tallahassee who is like this same kind of almost batshit crazy Zombi -killer the clash of personalities is really",29.08,47.76,NEGATIVE,0.9329633116722107,-0.9329633116722107

basically the These girls try to get one over on the guys all the time like steal the truck steal the ammo all that stuff So and it just goes to show that you really can't trust anyone in this situation Zombieland is a really successful horror comedy as it contains,64.86,83.3,POSITIVE,0.9901975393295288,0.9901975393295288

While it also maintains its kind of detached,92.48,96.64,NEGATIVE,0.9966163039207458,-0.9966163039207458
"Satire of the genre, but it's really well done I have to say that I thought the credit sequence which I won't give too much away because You really want to see it for yourself It's basically a slow -motion showcase of different events this credit sequence I think is the best credit sequence Since watchman and I honestly think if we hadn't have seen watchman This would be the best credit sequence of the year.",98.47,124.35,POSITIVE,0.9970826506614685,0.9970826506614685
It really is good I mean it uses and this just doesn't apply to the,124.35,129.29,POSITIVE,0.9262799620628357,0.9262799620628357
"Credit sequence on its own but applies to the movie as a whole it really knows how to use Slow motion without making it a gimmick the sequences at the beginning of the film which feature Columbus explaining some of his rules to Surviving a zombie apocalypse are really well done like rule number one cardio the you know The fat people die first in the apocalypse and stuff like that the I thought those sequences were really well done And I don't want to go into his rules because like I said, I really don't want to spoil it for people But it's a very kind of",130.17,160.31,POSITIVE,0.9704110026359558,0.9704110026359558
Stylistic edge on it It's it's almost like imagine if Tarantino directed a zombie movie and the style of the film like the The freeze frames of slow motion the the jump cuts and all that stuff feels very kind of,161.17,175.49,NEGATIVE,0.745688259601593,-0.745688259601593
Tarantino esque and I got a real kick out of it because I think it really suited The the tone of the film that they were going for performance is all across the border really good and,176.41,186.51,POSITIVE,0.9998143315315247,0.9998143315315247
Especially woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg now woody Harrelson when you first meet him as Tallahassee It's somewhat of a cliched character like we've seen this guy Many times before in these kind of situations you know But once the plot twist is revealed and you look back on woody Harrelson's character traits He really does manage to layer the character a lot more than he ought to Jesse Eisenberg does really well as Columbus and this guy,187.15,214.95,POSITIVE,0.8114269971847534,0.8114269971847534
"He's got that kind of deadpan humor and kind of uneasy uncomfortable mannerisms about him imagine Michael Cera if he didn't play the same role in every film this dudes like the new Michael Cera, you know But he's much more",215.65,230.27,POSITIVE,0.9744405746459961,0.9744405746459961

It's a better actor.,233.57,234.23,POSITIVE,0.9932987093925476,0.9932987093925476
"I feel like he was playing a character not just playing himself You know, so I thought Jesse Eisenberg was really good in this movie One of the standout moments in this film is um a celebrity cameo who I won't give away who it is But it could quite easily feel out of place having such a big star in the middle of this kind of low -key zombie movie but",234.37,255.35,NEGATIVE,0.7259882092475891,-0.7259882092475891
It didn't feel out of place the way they set it up the way they built it up And you know They were talking about who it's going to be and stuff like that and then when it's revealed It doesn't feel out of place.,256.15,265.97,NEGATIVE,0.9913482069969177,-0.9913482069969177
It just it's brilliant and it's it really is flat out hilarious I mean people in my theater were belly laughing at that moment as was I So that was a really well done cameo that really it didn't feel like it bogged down the film whatsoever to me If I had to poke holes in the film i'd say that um at times I Kind of wished it took the material a little bit more seriously now,266.11,289.91,POSITIVE,0.9985124468803406,0.9985124468803406

quite feel scared,309.09,310.79,NEGATIVE,0.9880857467651367,-0.9880857467651367
As you should but that's just a minor niggle because you're having so much fun while you're watching it that it really doesn't matter Another minor niggle I have with the film is the runtime.,311.53,320.51,POSITIVE,0.9914280772209167,0.9914280772209167
I think it's about 90 minutes.,320.51,322.17,NEGATIVE,0.9336486458778381,-0.9336486458778381
"I'm really not sure but um When I was watching it, it seemed to be over like that and it could have done to be a little bit longer And you could have used extra time to just um flesh out woody harrelson's character a little bit more because like I said He managed to um take what is essentially a cliched character and really add some kind of deep layers to him So, you know giving a little bit of an extra runtime He could have really fleshed it out I enjoyed it and I was sad when it was over So I just wish there was more of it if I had to give zombie land a rating item.",322.29,350.63,NEGATIVE,0.9861018657684326,-0.9861018657684326

"It it could have done a lot more but I know that they wanted to kind of keep it mainstream And it has apparently been very successful over in the states So, um, hopefully we'll get a sequel because this is a film that i'd actually like to see a sequel to and see where these characters Go after the movie but watching it.",369.83,385.51,POSITIVE,0.9718294143676758,0.9718294143676758
"I had a lot of fun while I was watching it I didn't think that it's revolutionized the zombie genre rather than just um It's kind of like more of a love letter to the zombie genre than anything else Um, so it's not revolutionary, but it is a really really good time at the cinema and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone So i'd give it three stars for being a really good solid Fun movie.",385.51,405.93,POSITIVE,0.9998134970664978,0.9998134970664978
