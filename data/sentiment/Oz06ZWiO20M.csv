"I was expecting it to be bad It really is not Trying to be a dramatic film or an action film like I think most people that's their knock on it Is that it's not, you know conventionally satisfying is like, you know A drama that we don't get to know anything about these characters their plight isn't interesting their path to freedom is not Compelling and it's basically telescoped within the first 10 minutes of the movie where we're sort of told what's gonna happen before it happens And all those things are true, but I don't think it's trying to be that I think it's really much more Like a musical and I know this is gonna sound silly because it's such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie But it really has more in common with a musical or an opera or even a ballet then a regular narrative film because like a main a mainstream narrative film is about character development and plot and then Spectacle like in third place So it's like put some people in it that you're gonna enjoy spending time with or some funny dialogue make them compelling in their relationships",80.6,144.72,NEGATIVE,0.9990653395652771,-0.9990653395652771
"Compelling and then have a story that's like at five minutes This happens in ten minutes this happens that like moves forward and has momentum and then you know Put in some action or some romance and sex or whatever to keep people sort of engaged And that's what traditional narrative movies do and this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is and the characters They're all just placeholders It's really like if you went to go see the ballet and it's about the spectacles like the story of Swan Lake isn't why people go see Swan Lake it's the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and To the experience and I get that that's what Zack Snyder was going for with this And I think I feel like most of the reviews I've read do not Acknowledge that that this is more like Moulin Rouge now, maybe you you hate Moulin Rouge I know a lot of people who do and even stylistically this is kind of similar like it moves really fast It's really colorful and there's tons of effects going on and it's you know It's like sensory overload and this movie is really going for a lot of the same things only instead of being an actual musical There's lots of music, but it's it's more focused on like action and effects and that kind of movement instead of like dancing and song",145.34,213.96,NEGATIVE,0.9485529661178589,-0.9485529661178589
"So, I mean, yeah But like everybody who's been knocking it like why don't care about these characters and there's so many different levels of reality Going on in the movie that I never had time to invest in any like I agree with all that But it's sort of not to the point like he didn't have to succeed in that way He could have succeeded just by making the film pure spectacle and if it worked on that level just like Moulin Rouge where you don't have to care about you and McGregor to enjoy Moulin Rouge It's the music and and the the experience of taking it all in so I think in principle This could have worked the bare -bones story, which is it's about a girl She's 20 years old, but she dresses like she's you know, it's sort of 12",214.86,252.72,NEGATIVE,0.9906941056251526,-0.9906941056251526

"but yeah, like you just so it that there's that level of abstraction going on and then every time the The main character does one of her routines and she uses it to distract them to help the other Strippers to plot their escape or whatever we go into even another level of fantasy Which is where the action scenes happen, and it's all set to music There's no dialogue, and it's always like classic rock songs remix, and I'll talk more about the use of music later But so that's that's a movie It's like so many different levels of abstraction You're not ever really kind of sure what the level of reality you're going back to is or you know What about this is real and what's all in their heads and what the other girls are?",370.74,407.24,NEGATIVE,0.9944144487380981,-0.9944144487380981
"Experiencing in addition to the main character And so I get that people are leaving it like what and thinking it's not satisfying as like a normal tradition A movie would be but okay it could have worked But here's why it doesn't even work on the pure spectacle level and I should say as pure spectacle There are sequences and individual moments that do work there was there's this one setting That's like this feudal Japan samurai movie Inspired setting and it looks really cool and the villains look cool, and there's one in the poster.",407.6,439.76,NEGATIVE,0.9305806756019592,-0.9305806756019592
That's like this big Japanese statue that's firing like a minigun and like it looks cool in the effects work for me The action and that scene is kind of fun and actually that's an earlier fantasy And while that was on I was like you know what this may not be as bad as people think I think people are just Misreading the movie it sort of went downhill from there But so anyway my point is that there are some of the effects are good some of the moments are good some of the actions Good he doesn't do that annoying shaky cam Paul Greengrass nonsense So you can actually see the action that's happening sometimes and the guys the guys a talented guy visually He's very talented.,439.76,471.08,POSITIVE,0.9914012551307678,0.9914012551307678

I'm still looking forward to Superman even after this movie But I think overall the movies not that successful is spectacle if there's so many effects There's so much going on it's busy and it all kind of blows past you I feel like if the movie had slowed down a bit I could have and there's a lot of slow -mo That's not what I mean But I mean the overall pace of these sequences I could have taken in more and maybe appreciated more of the artistry of what I was Seeing instead of it's sort of a mile a minute And there's so much being thrown in the girls as I mentioned not only not sexy But they don't really seem to like know what they're supposed to be doing in the action Fantasy spectacle parts like they seem pretty at home as the prostitutes but then once you get them as like soldiers and they're in like years of war attire and they're shooting at people like they just don't seem like They know whether they're supposed to really be in the reality of this scenario or whether they know it's a fantasy or or they're They're happy about it like they just kind of seem confused and so you never really get into them like they're they're sort of,476.18,532.0,NEGATIVE,0.9992751479148865,-0.9992751479148865
"It's kind of all flat all the female performances when it should be we should like them We should find I mean we don't have to like get to know them as characters But we should root for them at least in these sequences the other thing about the genre mash -ups like Kill Bill a lot of people have mentioned Kill Bill because that's another movie where a director like Puts every single other kind of movie that he likes into the movie And it's a good point of reference because what Tarantino does that makes Kill Bill and his other movie So good at the Coen brothers to when they reference old genres is they he really adopts the style of those on genres He's doing two things at once in Kill Bill He's taking like spaghetti westerns or 70s crime and suspense movies or you know kung fu movies And he's taking recognizable bits and pieces of them and recreating them very recognizably I mean you like the pie may sequence in Kill Bill looks like you know an old Shaw brothers or 70s kung fu movie And so he's both replicating these old styles, and then using them to advance this new story He's telling so a perfect example is when the bride see somebody she recognizes that she wants to get revenge on and we close in On their eyes, and it's like that",532.78,598.7,POSITIVE,0.988223671913147,0.988223671913147
"Like he's taking a 70s like exploitation black exploitation Sort of effect and moment but using it to advance his own story about Uma Thurman as the bride wanting to get revenge That's the genius of Kill Bill and of Tarantino Zack Snyder's not doing that He's basically just taking every little like aspect of cult movies He likes and just jamming it all together like there's no rhyme or reason to it whatsoever first of all We're in the fantasy mind of this 20 year old girl Like are these the things that she's obsessed with like robots and zombies and science fiction and I mean I don't want to be misogynistic there are plenty of like geeky girls that are into that but wouldn't you Woman's fantasy and I don't I don't mean to get like comments like hey I'm a girl, and I love I know girls love zombies and all that stuff It just it seems it clashes and we're never like if we were shown a scene in the beginning where she's got like a Ninja poster up over bed, and it established like she's a geek and she loves these kinds of movies Okay, but it doesn't it doesn't have any reason to suddenly show up And he's really like I'm not against the idea of insane stripper soldiers engaging robot zombie Nazis in World War one style trench warfare Let me make that clear I'm pro that but like the movie doesn't feel like a World War one movie or a zombie movie or a soldier, you know Movie or a stripper movie like he doesn't really get into any of those genres.",599.74,690.58,NEGATIVE,0.983370304107666,-0.983370304107666
It's just all in his movie It all always feels like a Zack Snyder movie so like shiny and in slow motion And that just makes it inherently uninteresting and I think that's why you saw so many comments on the web that were disappointed like Zack Snyder managed to make robot Nazi zombies boring and I love those and it's like you love movies that feel like Nazi zombie movies You don't love movies that just happen to have Nazi zombies sitting around not doing anything and that's the problem here He's like putting them in the movie and then not engaging them Which is frustrating because you're seeing things that you love you're like hey those are robot soldiers I love those like let's have a scene with them And then they're just there and then they're gone and they really have nothing to do with anything else that you've seen Finally cuz I know I'm going way long the music choices like I feel like this should have been a Musical hear me out like you have these these women five female main characters Some of them are even like Vanessa Hudgens is in the movie and she sings She's been in musicals and instead of anybody singing on camera.,690.58,751.16,NEGATIVE,0.997886598110199,-0.997886598110199
